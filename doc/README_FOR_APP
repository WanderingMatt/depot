Depotâ€™s use cases are simple (some would say tragically so). We start off by identifying two different roles or actors: the buyer and the seller. 

The buyer uses Depot to browse the products we have to sell, select some to purchase, and supply the information needed to create an order. 

The seller uses Depot to maintain a list of products to sell, to determine the orders that are awaiting shipping, and to mark orders as shipped. The seller also uses Depot to make scads of money and retire to a tropical island.
